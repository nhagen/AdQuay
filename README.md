AdQuay
======

A central dashboard that makes managing complex network stacks easy.

AdQuay has three core functionalities.

1. Retrieve and consolidate ad performance data from external sources
2. Persist and manage external ad performance data
3. Expose ad perfomance data for use by other applications

AdQuay is not a data visualization or analysis platform. AdQuay is, however,
designed to be highly compatible with external applications through a built in
restful external API, and an easy to use internal development API allowing for
other types of endpoints installable as modules.

Because this is a data aggregation tool for disparate external sources, it is
designed to be highly modular and extendable. Different networks might require
wildly different data retrieval systems, and different stacks and setups can
require wildly different management portals. Users might require access to the
data via multiple endpoints.

Installing modules should be simple. Developing modules should be
straightforward and consistent.
